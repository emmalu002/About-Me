        <H1>Welcome!</H1>
        <H2>Hello! Here's some information about me!</H2>
        <H3>Hey! My name is Emma Lu. I was born and raised in West Jordan, Utah. Currently, I am a student attending Itineris Early College High School. Yes, you read that right, I amattending college while I am attending high school. High school so far has been a wonderful yet stressful experience. However, I know that the stress I am experiencing now will be worth it when I grow up and make a difference in the world. When I am grown up, I hope to pursue some type of job in the medical field. There is just some type of wonderful feeling that I get to know that I have to potential to help out others. 
                Since I am interested in the medical field, I have joined a club called HOSA, which stands for future health professionals. In this club, we learn about different medical occupations, health systems, and we sometimes dissect things. Being in this club has only made me more excited to be successful in high school and in college so that I can pursue my dreams of working in the medical field.
                Whenever I am not doing homework or studying for tests, you will see me hanging out with my friends of family. I love to spend my time with people that I enjoy hanging out with. We will probably be doing something outside whether it is biking, hiking, or even swimming. Whatever it is, I hope my path of education will lead me to my hopes and desires!</H3>
